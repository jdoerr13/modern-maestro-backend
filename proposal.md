Capstone Two Project Proposal: 
ModernMaestro
1. Technology Stack
ModernMaestro will be developed using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. For data management, I will utilize PostgreSQL.  I will create my own RESTful API to serve, manage, and retrieve classical music data, ensuring seamless integration with the frontend.
2. Focus Area
This project will be a balanced full-stack application, with an emphasis on both the frontend UI and backend services. The frontend will provide an engaging and intuitive experience for users, while the backend will focus on efficient data handling, security, and real-time communication, with a particular emphasis on managing and delivering new classical music content.
3. Platform Type
The ModernMaestro project will be developed as a web application to ensure broad accessibility and convenience, allowing users from anywhere to access the platform without the need for additional software.
4. Project Goal
The primary goal of ModernMaestro is to promote new classical music, focusing on modern composers (even students) & compositions from the last ten years. It aims to connect contemporary classical music composers, performers, and enthusiasts in a digital hub, facilitating the discovery, collaboration, and sharing of modern classical music across the globe.
5. User Demographic
Target users include contemporary classical music composers, musicians, educators, and enthusiasts interested in the latest compositions and performances. The platform will cater to individuals seeking to explore and engage with classical music created in the last five-ten years, offering features accessible to users of varying technical and musical expertise.
6. Data Usage and Collection
ModernMaestro will primarily collect data through external APIs that provide access to databases of classical music compositions and recordings. Emphasis will be on integrating sources that feature music composed in the last ten years. Additionally, composers will have the ability to create pages for their music, which may include compositions older than ten years, ensuring a comprehensive database.
The API, built using Node.js and Express, will manage this data within a PostgreSQL database. This setup will allow us to implement data models and querying capabilities, enabling users to filter music based on specific time frames, from the most recent year up to the last decade.
7. Project Approach
Database Schema: The PostgreSQL database will include tables for users, compositions, performances, composers, instrumentation, and user interactions, with a specific focus on the YearOfComposition field to enable filtering by composition date.
Creating the API: Challenges in creating my API may include ensuring data accuracy and consistency, especially when integrating with external classical music APIs. I'll implement robust error handling and data validation processes to maintain the integrity of my database.
Security: I will secure sensitive data, such as user authentication details and API keys, using industry-standard encryption and secure storage practices.
Functionality: Key features will include advanced search filters to explore compositions by year, composer profiles, community networking opportunities, and tools for online collaboration.
User Flow: Starting from a welcoming landing page, users can navigate to discover new compositions, engage with community features, or use tools designed for composers and performers.
Stretch Goals: Beyond the core functionalities, I envision integrating real-time collaborative tools for composers, virtual performance spaces, and personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and interactions.
*Additional Legalities and Functionality:
Legal Music Integration and Playback
I aim to promote new classical music with ModernMaestro while ensuring all content is shared legally. To achieve this, I will focus on two primary strategies:
Providing Links to Legal Music Sources
I will predominantly provide links to external sites where users can listen to or purchase music legally. This approach allows users to explore a vast array of classical music without me directly hosting or streaming potentially copyrighted material on my platform. It also aligns with my goal of promoting new compositions by directing traffic to official music platforms, supporting artists and rights holders.
Embedding Music Samples
To create a more immersive user experience, I plan to incorporate music samples using the HTML5 <audio> tag and React components. This method enables basic playback functionalities like play, pause, and volume control, ensuring compatibility across modern web browsers and devices.
HTML5 Audio Tag: Simple audio samples embedded directly on the platform will utilize the HTML5 <audio> tag, offering users a seamless way to preview music.
Advanced Playback Features: To enhance the user experience, I will develop custom audio player components using JavaScript and React. This will allow me to implement advanced features such as progress bars, playlists, and visualizations, tailored to match the aesthetic of my website.
Utilization of Libraries and Frameworks: Leveraging libraries like Howler.js and React components such as react-h5-audio-player will streamline the development of my custom audio player. These tools offer extensive functionality for audio playback and manipulation, simplifying the process of creating a rich, user-friendly audio experience.
Legal Considerations and Compliance
Licensing and Copyright: I will carefully review the licensing agreements of the APIs I use to ensure compliance with their terms, focusing on legally obtained music. For music samples embedded within my site, I will either use content that is in the public domain or obtain the necessary licenses to share music legally.
Attribution: When required, I will provide appropriate attribution for each piece of music, respecting the rights and contributions of the creators.
Consultation with Legal Experts: To navigate the complexities of copyright law and music licensing, I will consult with legal professionals. This ensures that my platform operates within legal boundaries, respecting the intellectual property of composers and artists.
Technology Stack and Implementation
Frontend Development: My application will be built using React, enabling the creation of a dynamic and responsive user interface. Custom audio players developed with React components will enhance the music discovery experience.
Backend Development: Node.js with Express will serve as the backbone of my backend, handling API requests, user management, and data processing. My own RESTful API will manage music data within a PostgreSQL database, designed to support complex queries and efficient data retrieval.
Music Playback: The integration of HTML5 audio features and JavaScript libraries will facilitate music playback directly on my platform, providing users with a seamless experience of discovering and enjoying new classical music samples.
Project Focus and User Experience
ModernMaestro is dedicated to showcasing contemporary classical music from the last decade, making it easily accessible to enthusiasts worldwide. By linking to legal music sources and embedding music samples, I aim to create a comprehensive platform that respects the rights of creators while offering an enriched user experience. Advanced search filters, community networking opportunities, and collaboration tools will encourage exploration and engagement within the classical music community.
Conclusion
My approach to integrating music legally, combined with the use of modern web technologies, positions ModernMaestro as a pioneering resource for discovering and promoting new classical music. By respecting copyright laws and focusing on user experience, ModernMaestro will foster a vibrant community of classical music lovers, supporting artists and composers in the digital age.
